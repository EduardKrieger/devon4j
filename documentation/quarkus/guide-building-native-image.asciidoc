= Building a native image

Quarkus provides the ability to create a native executable of the application. This improves the startup time, performance and efficiency. Also, a JVM is not needed because it is included in the application. A distribution of GraalVM is needed. You can find the differences between the available distributions https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image#graalvm[here].

=== Installing GraalVM

A native image can be created locally or through a container environment. To create a native image locally an installed and configured version of GraalVM is needed, you can follow the https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image#prerequisites-for-oracle-graalvm-ceee[installation guide from Quarkus] or the https://www.graalvm.org/docs/getting-started/#install-graalvm[guide provided by GraalVM] for this. 



=== Build a native executable with GraalVM

To build a Quarkus application you can read the link:quarkus-template.asciidoc#basic-templates[basic Quarkus application chapter] , or clone the https://github.com/devonfw-sample/devon4quarkus-reference[example project] provided by devonfw. 
Follow this https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image#producing-a-native-executable[chapter] from the Quarkus Guide for building a native executable.



=== Build a native executable with GraalVM through container environment

You can build the Linux executables without installing GraalVM locally or sometimes you just need the Linux executables on Windows to run them in a container. To do that you need a working container runtime, we recommend Docker. You can simply install Docker with your devonfw-ide distribution just follow this description https://github.com/devonfw/ide/blob/master/documentation/docker.asciidoc[Docker with devonfw-ide].

.Docker on Windows
[NOTE]
There are two modes for Docker on Windows, if you are using it in Hyper-V mode and not WSL 2 mode you have to share the project drive in the Docker settings or you will face some errors. 

Follow this https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image#container-runtime[chapter] to build a native Linux image through container runtime. 

=== Configuring the native executable 

The native executable can be configured with properties provided with the application.properties. A list of the properties can be found https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image#configuration-reference[here].
